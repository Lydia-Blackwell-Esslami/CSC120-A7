- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I actually really like inheritance, I think it's the most useful thing we've done in this class so far. It take as little bit of effort if you start with an idea for a couple classes that are similar to like reverse engineer a parent class for them but it's defiently worth the extra up-front planning cost. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The foreEach method of the hashtable was confusing but I really wanted to use it. I ended up googling it and I copied like two lines of from the AI result that pops up when you google things. It worked so I'm going with it, the only thing I don't get is what the -> does. Like I mean I know what it does, it gives the variables to the action statment inside the method, but I feel like I ended up with a heavily shortcutted version  and there's a longer way of writing it that would only involve syntax we used in class. On the other hand after reading the first articile that came up (which the AI overview probably pulled directly from), they used to -> so maybe that's just how it works? The javadoc for the method wasn't really helpful in my opinion. 

The interface for the cafe doesn't have restock as a private method. I tried to change it to be private and it broke everything so I just deleted restock from the interface.
